    - (obj) instanceof (Class)
        -This statement is self-explanatory. When you create an object using the 'new Class(...args)' syntax, that object is an instance of Class.
        -An example of a use case for this would be checking if something is a Vector3.
            [camera.position instanceof BABYLON.Vector3]
    - importing module in html makes it so that you won't need to import it in your other scripts
        -uhh, im not certain about this one, but at least we dont need to import babylon everywhere

    - IN order to use element.focus, it needs to be called in a short-running event handler.
        - In other words, element.focus will run if caused by a user action such as clicking, hovering, etc.

    - Unfortunately the multiple-input problem is indeed a laptop issue.
        - On my computer and mouse, I have no issues moving the mouse (and the camera) while pressing on the keyboard.
        - On my laptop (only the laptop; no mouse), trackpad input sometimes does not work while pressing on the keyboard; it works once keyboard input stops.
