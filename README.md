# not the place

Pull up, then I swerve
Ain't got no pancakes, but I been pouring out the syrup
My twin ready to blitz, all I gotta do is say the word
He really ain't on ****, that boy just chirping like a bird
He think I want his *****, don't want his *****, she get curved
I mean, I ain't want his ***** until I seen the way she
