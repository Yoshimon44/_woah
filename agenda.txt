Thirty pointers, every night, yeah, me and yo' ***** droppin' thirty pointers
Takin' flights, yeah, with yo' *****, we in Singapore

I'm that type of ***** that post yo' *****, and you can't ignore
Now when everybody see that *****, they like, "Oh, there go Ken Carson's *****"
Yeah, I get fly like a raven, but a ***** not in Baltimore
