//to-do list; please add any requests here

- stair system
    - most likely already implemented, needs further testing on actual stairs (ramps)

- enemy ai (aw heck naw)
    -the idea here is that for each enemy i make an agent (that isn't actually attached to the enemy)
    everytime the enemy needs to pathfind the agent will tp to the enemy and begin pathfinding
    the enemy will follow the agent until it can see the player again, then the agent will be neglected
    the agent will come back once the enemy can no longer see the player ðŸ’€

- no mo flying
